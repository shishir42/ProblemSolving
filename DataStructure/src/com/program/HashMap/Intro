Collision Handling 

1. Separate Chaining(Direct Chaining) 
2. Open Addressing (Linear probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing)

3. The Load factor is a measure that decides when to increase the HashMap capacity to maintain the get() and put() operation complexity of O(1). 
The default load factor of HashMap is 0.75f (75% of the map size).

The load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased

When the total number of items in hashmap goes on increasing keeping the default initial capacity of hashmap 16, At one point of time,
 hashmap performance will start degrading and need to increase buckets for improving performance.
 
 Load Factor is a measure, which decides when exactly to increase the hashmap capacity(buckets) to maintain get and put operation complexity of O(1).
